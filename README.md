# eja_arti
EjaArti is my writing pad to save all my random thought regarding the social condition in the world that we live on. Often times, I translate some articles that I find interesting, but sometimes I write my own piece based on the event that I want to delve deeper on. This blog is created using Hugo-Novela theme.
